## How Sales Numbers Are Calculated

### Weekly Sales Calculation Methods

**Basic Weekly Sales Formula:**
```
Weekly Sales = Total Revenue Generated in 7-Day Period
             = ∑(Unit Price × Quantity Sold) for all products/services
```

**Key Components:**
- **Gross Sales**: Total amount invoiced before any deductions
- **Net Sales**: Gross sales minus returns, discounts, and allowances
- **Units Sold**: Total number of products/services sold
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Total sales ÷ Number of orders
- **Sales per Day**: Weekly sales ÷ 7 days

**Advanced Metrics:**
- **Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth**: ((Current Week Sales - Same Week Last Year) ÷ Same Week Last Year) × 100
- **Week-over-Week (WoW) Change**: ((Current Week - Previous Week) ÷ Previous Week) × 100
- **Moving Average**: Average of last N weeks to smooth out fluctuations
- **Sales Conversion Rate**: (Number of Sales ÷ Number of Leads) × 100

### Factors Affecting Calculation Accuracy
- **Timing of recognition**: When sales are recorded (order date vs. delivery date vs. payment date)
- **Currency adjustments**: For multi-currency businesses
- **Returns and refunds**: How and when they are accounted for
- **Subscription vs. one-time sales**: Different recognition patterns
- **Channel attribution**: Properly crediting different sales channels

### Best Practices for Sales Tracking
1. **Consistent timing**: Use the same week definitions (Mon-Sun vs. Sun-Sat)
2. **Clean data**: Ensure accurate product categorization and customer segmentation
3. **Regular reconciliation**: Match sales reports with financial records
4. **Trend analysis**: Look at patterns over multiple weeks/months rather than isolated periods
5. **Context consideration**: Always analyze sales numbers within broader business and market context
